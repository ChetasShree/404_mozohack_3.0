## About Our project üîß

Babbler is a social media platform where user's privacy is given the most importance. No authentication, no location permissions, no email, not even a name is required to use Babbler, which means the site does not store any of the user's data at all. There are no hidden charges anywhere. You can share your ideas about anything and everything, freely, always.

## PLAN OF ACTION üö®

On Babbler, users have the freedom to express their thoughts freely. They can anonymously post, share their ideas or secrets, open discussion threads, or vent on the platform without feeling any judgment and without the fear of having their data stolen. Babbler is simply a canvas where you can see just how complex or simple the thoughts from around the world can be.
